Welcome!

Hi, there! My name is Chris and welcome to my website/blog.

I will use this blog format to post my progress on diving deeper into data science. In the process I also hope to improve on my english writing skills. So please bare with me.

Background

I'm german and a trained mechanical engineer with an interest in data science. Because of this on this blog you will most probably find posts relating to data science. Having said that, I am at the very beginning of my journey. For my main programming language I have chosen Python because it seems to be the most popular choice for this field.

So once again, welcome! And feel free to stick around.

Chris
